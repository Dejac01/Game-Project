This Car Card Matching Game is a simple card game where players need to match pairs by clicking on and flipping over 2 cards at a time.  
In this repo, I utilized Html, CSS, and JavaScript.
The main functions of focus within Javascript are as follows:
Utilizing for loops,
addEventListener,
set and getAttribute,
document.querySelector,
createElement,
and instructions for the game utilizing the alert function to begin,




INSTRUCTIONS:

Player one starts by flipping over one card before deciding to flip over another

If the card flipped matches, an alert notifies the player of their match and 3 points are added to the score.

These cards will then disappear, allowing player 2 to pick a match following the same steps. If player 2 receives a match, 3 points will then be added to their score.

If the cards flipped do not match at any point, another alert will notify players of this and the cards will flip back over with no points received. 

Each player gets one chance each turn.

The game continues until all cards have been matched and the board has been cleared.

The player with the most points win.
